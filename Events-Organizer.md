The complete guide for the Discord bot, Events Organizer!

# What Is Events Organizer?

Events Organizer is a fun utility bot for organizing your servers events. Say you want to host an epic game night with your community and/or friends. You can run a simple command with events organizer that will create a custom embedded message custom to your fitting. You can even put a hyperlink in the title of the message! Events Organizer is a constantly updated bot with very little down time as we host it on a reliable service. I really hope you enjoy the bot I made. Thank you for using Events Organizer!

# What Commands Do I Have?

Good question indeed! I have multiple commands that I will display below.

/`CreateEvent` - This is my main command, this will operate a function where you will be able to create your own custom embedded messages! When this command is executed, Events Organizer will then send you multiple prompt messages that you will need to answer in complete context.

/`Help` - I really don't know why I'm putting this command here but why not. This command just shows you all of the commands that function with Events Organizer, just like I'm doing here!

/`Ping` - This will show you the bots current ping. If the ping is higher, that means that the bots delay time will be longer and if the bots ping is lower, that means that the bots delay time will be faster!

/`Uptime` - This will show you how long the bot has been online for before it has been restarted. When the bot is restarted, this usually either means that it is updating or there has been an error throughout the time it has been online and needs to be restarted to be fixed.

/`Credits` - This will show you the credits towards the develpers of Events Organizer! Quite a simple command but why not get to know the developers of the bot.

# Extra Note

Hello, this is a message from the head developer of Events Organizer, `TwoBrake#5302`. I just want to take a moment to thank all of the people who have support Events Organizer. I started off this bot as just some silly little bot, now you guys have helped me turn it into something amazing. Thank you so much!

Sincerely, `TwoBrake#5302`.
